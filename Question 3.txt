3. Initialize On Object Creation
   i. Create a class Car which contains wheels and model as Instance variables.
   ii. Initialize the number of wheels of the car at the time of creating the Object of the 
   car and assign the model of the car to the model variable and print the model after 
   creating the object of the car class(not at the time of creating the object).


Code :

class Car 
{
    int wheels;
	String model;
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
        Car c = new Car();
		c.wheels = 4;
		c.model = "BMW";
		System.out.println("number of wheels of the car:" +c.wheels);
        System.out.println("Car Model:" +c.model);
	}
}
